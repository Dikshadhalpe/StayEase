# StayEase
StayEase is a mini full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb, developed with limited yet core features. It enables users to browse listings, view property details, and manage listings through a clean and responsive interface. This project demonstrates hands-on experience with backend APIs, database integration, and RESTful architecture.
